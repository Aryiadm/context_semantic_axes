The best advice I can give is to either live your life and socialize and reference what you've learned when applicable, or if you're still trying to break out your shell, pick one of those programs and damn stick to it.  The magic in those programs isn't in any magical techniques written in there (even if they try to convince you otherwise), it's that it forces you to actually interact with people and learn from those interactions.\n\nIf you lack the discipline to do that, go on ahead and do one of those bootcamps - you damn well won't be getting out of interactions once you've spent a lot of money on them and have someone watching your back the whole time.","ups":6,"parent_id":"t3_bkw2z","score":6,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":"1270083712","subreddit":"seduction","edited":false,"archived":true,"name":"t1_c0naaqq","author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"c0naaqq","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhrv"}

I'm glad you're feeling better.  Isn't this what we all want - To feel OK, to not feel depressed and burdened by compulsions, anxieties, fears, etc.?\n\nSecondly, I'm glad to hear you're a dude.  'Cause I was feeling slightly creepy talking nice to (what I thought was a) female sex addict.  Being that you're a guy, I do hope you know that at least some of what you've described (lots of masturbation, seeking out wild sex scenarios, lots of partners) is sort of normal for a male your age.  I think the most important things to keep in mind here is threefold: 1. wear a condom so you don't hurt yourself with a disease, 2. stop beating yourself up so much for having sexual impulses and 3. find out what else besides basic hormones is driving your libido.\n\nI'm glad to hear that your psychiatrist knows about the sex addiction, maybe you can talk to him about broaching the topic with your psychologist (therapist).  I certainly hope that you talk about your alcohol drinking with both of them.\n\nI don't want to be a dick here, but here's a friendly reminder that alcohol can actually kill you.  I grew up across the street from a family that was destroyed by alcoholism.  The parents got divorced, and then the son became an alcoholic and committed suicide, and shortly afterwards the father drank himself to death.  One family - totally destroyed by alcohol.  Fuuuuuuu.  Sad, sad, sad.\n\nI hope that you talk to both your psychologist and psychiatrist about your drinking and weed use.  At a minimum, you owe it to the psychiatrist to know these things so that he has a decent chance of prescribing the right medication to you.  \n\nWell, whether  you decide to talk about your sex addiction to the therapist you already know well, or talk about it in a group of mostly strangers, it sounds to me like you're getting to be OK with talking about it.  I can certainly tell that you have some concerns about being thought of as a weirdo (or some kind of monster, I can't tell which), but taking the risk of talking about it in a therapeutic environment seems like a your odds of getting a negative response are low.  I certainly hope that your kinks are only related to adults and not to minors 'cause well.... I have another story about a former neighbor who destroyed his life because he was a pedophile.  Well, whatever the specific kinks you're into, it's better to get some help and get it off your chest around people you can trust and can expect to react in a mature, helpful way about things.\n\nI hope that instead of letting your mind run off with self-criticism, that you'll be able to interrupt your thoughts or at least count the number of times you have self-critical thoughts.  Simply recognizing the thought as they happen (I know this is somewhat difficult because you can't both think a thought and be aware of the thought at the same time) or just immediately after they happen is a good practice to get into.  And when you start to notice that your mind becomes an endless spring of self-criticism, you can start to tell yourself, \"here we go again, I should really try to think of something more positive\" or \"oh, these negative thoughts are so tedious and depressing, they're so non-constructive and harmful.  It would be nice if I could think of almost anything else.\"  Just simply recognizing your self-critical thoughts as they happen (or shortly thereafter) - as opposed to getting lost in them - will be so much better for you.  I know you have it in you to change your thinking and to separate your thoughts from yourself and to objectify your thoughts as separate from yourself.  That way, hopefully, you won't feel so depressed and brought down by all these self-critical thoughts and you won't feel the need to drink or smoke weed to the point of blacking out.\n\nI'm sure you know that drugging until you black out is not going to work out for you in the long run.  No need to lecture there.  I hate to see you in pain like this and I hope you can find ways to interrupt whatever train of negative or self-critical thoughts may be brewing.  \n\nAs for your \"failings\" think about this - the history of philosophy is littered with failures and failed thinking.  Even the most brilliant people fail - and repeatedly too.  The important thing (you know what I'm going to say, I know you do) is that you keep trying.  Give yourself some credit and make note of the progress you've made.  Perhaps you should think about the myth of Sisyphus.  The Greek story of the man who was doomed to roll a rock uphill for all eternity.  So what if you never get to this (overly-)romanticized goal of perfection?  The most amazing thing about you is you have the strength to keep picking yourself up and dusting yourself off over and over again.  That's what makes you strong.\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry if I've been sounding preachy, I don't mean to be a dickhole.  I know that in my personal life I have to deal with my unipolar depression - which is its own trial.  So I hope you don't think I'm talking down to you.  We all have our own stones to roll uphill.  I hope you'll consider some of my suggestions.  And more importantly, I hope you have continued success and continued will to fight the good fight.
