The best advice I can give is to either live your life and socialize and reference what you've learned when applicable, or if you're still trying to break out your shell, pick one of those programs and damn stick to it.  The magic in those programs isn't in any magical techniques written in there (even if they try to convince you otherwise), it's that it forces you to actually interact with people and learn from those interactions.\n\nIf you lack the discipline to do that, go on ahead and do one of those bootcamps - you damn well won't be getting out of interactions once you've spent a lot of money on them and have someone watching your back the whole time.","ups":6,"parent_id":"t3_bkw2z","score":6,"distinguished":null,"created_utc":"1270083712","subreddit":"seduction","edited":false,"archived":true,"name":"t1_c0naaqq","author_flair_css_class":null,"id":"c0naaqq","author_flair_text":null,"subreddit_id":"t5_2qhrv"}

I'm glad you're feeling better.  Isn't this what we all want - To feel OK, to not feel depressed and burdened by compulsions, anxieties, fears, etc.?\n\nSecondly, I'm glad to hear you're a dude.  'Cause I was feeling slightly creepy talking nice to (what I thought was a) female sex addict.  Being that you're a guy, I do hope you know that at least some of what you've described (lots of masturbation, seeking out wild sex scenarios, lots of partners) is sort of normal for a male your age.  I think the most important things to keep in mind here is threefold: 1. wear a condom so you don't hurt yourself with a disease, 2. stop beating yourself up so much for having sexual impulses and 3. find out what else besides basic hormones is driving your libido.\n\nI'm glad to hear that your psychiatrist knows about the sex addiction, maybe you can talk to him about broaching the topic with your psychologist (therapist).  I certainly hope that you talk about your alcohol drinking with both of them.\n\nI don't want to be a dick here, but here's a friendly reminder that alcohol can actually kill you.  I grew up across the street from a family that was destroyed by alcoholism.  The parents got divorced, and then the son became an alcoholic and committed suicide, and shortly afterwards the father drank himself to death.  One family - totally destroyed by alcohol.  Fuuuuuuu.  Sad, sad, sad.\n\nI hope that you talk to both your psychologist and psychiatrist about your drinking and weed use.  At a minimum, you owe it to the psychiatrist to know these things so that he has a decent chance of prescribing the right medication to you.  \n\nWell, whether  you decide to talk about your sex addiction to the therapist you already know well, or talk about it in a group of mostly strangers, it sounds to me like you're getting to be OK with talking about it.  I can certainly tell that you have some concerns about being thought of as a weirdo (or some kind of monster, I can't tell which), but taking the risk of talking about it in a therapeutic environment seems like a your odds of getting a negative response are low.  I certainly hope that your kinks are only related to adults and not to minors 'cause well.... I have another story about a former neighbor who destroyed his life because he was a pedophile.  Well, whatever the specific kinks you're into, it's better to get some help and get it off your chest around people you can trust and can expect to react in a mature, helpful way about things.\n\nI hope that instead of letting your mind run off with self-criticism, that you'll be able to interrupt your thoughts or at least count the number of times you have self-critical thoughts.  Simply recognizing the thought as they happen (I know this is somewhat difficult because you can't both think a thought and be aware of the thought at the same time) or just immediately after they happen is a good practice to get into.  And when you start to notice that your mind becomes an endless spring of self-criticism, you can start to tell yourself, \"here we go again, I should really try to think of something more positive\" or \"oh, these negative thoughts are so tedious and depressing, they're so non-constructive and harmful.  It would be nice if I could think of almost anything else.\"  Just simply recognizing your self-critical thoughts as they happen (or shortly thereafter) - as opposed to getting lost in them - will be so much better for you.  I know you have it in you to change your thinking and to separate your thoughts from yourself and to objectify your thoughts as separate from yourself.  That way, hopefully, you won't feel so depressed and brought down by all these self-critical thoughts and you won't feel the need to drink or smoke weed to the point of blacking out.\n\nI'm sure you know that drugging until you black out is not going to work out for you in the long run.  No need to lecture there.  I hate to see you in pain like this and I hope you can find ways to interrupt whatever train of negative or self-critical thoughts may be brewing.  \n\nAs for your \"failings\" think about this - the history of philosophy is littered with failures and failed thinking.  Even the most brilliant people fail - and repeatedly too.  The important thing (you know what I'm going to say, I know you do) is that you keep trying.  Give yourself some credit and make note of the progress you've made.  Perhaps you should think about the myth of Sisyphus.  The Greek story of the man who was doomed to roll a rock uphill for all eternity.  So what if you never get to this (overly-)romanticized goal of perfection?  The most amazing thing about you is you have the strength to keep picking yourself up and dusting yourself off over and over again.  That's what makes you strong.\n\nAnyway, I'm sorry if I've been sounding preachy, I don't mean to be a dickhole.  I know that in my personal life I have to deal with my unipolar depression - which is its own trial.  So I hope you don't think I'm talking down to you.  We all have our own stones to roll uphill.  I hope you'll consider some of my suggestions.  And more importantly, I hope you have continued success and continued will to fight the good fight.

They will judge you on the things that intellectually we shouldn't judge others. But you know what? Life is unfair. We judge people based on appearances far more than we do performance/personality --- at least as first. Let's face it, no one likes ugly people, but at least we have many opportunities to improve ourselves (i.e. working out, dressing well, etc. etc.) to get past that initial boundary. **You have to.**\n\nB) Being the cocky and even asshole guy is far more beneficial with talking to girls and gaining their respect than being nice and being friendly. That's how it works. \n\n&gt; All I can see from my perspective (and I'm being perfectly serious) is that you're telling me I'm an inferior man.\n\nBeing honest is the first step in improving oneself. I was depressed at one point in my life --- and I was honest with myself. I tried tricking myself/saying to myself that i'm happy blah blah, but that is useless. Rather, the more realistic thing was to realize that there was a deficiency in me that was correctable and improving it. \n\nThe point is that wherever there are inferior qualities, you recognize them and improve them. \n\n&gt; Perhaps you should read \"how to win friends and influence people\".\n\nI have. The main point is to listen to others and be interested in them. It's not that difficult.\n\n&gt; I resent you for calling me a failure\n\nNever did. I just pointed out that not being fit, not looking sharp, being poor, spending time on the computer, are all hurting you. They are ALL correctable/easily improved upon. \n\n&gt; as it hurts people's feelings and makes them dislike you and want to go out of their way to make your life difficult.\n\nYou're a man and you're 21/22. This is the attitude of a soft man and you need to toughen up. You need to develop thick skin because girls can see through that. Don't become a douchebag, but learn to adopt a badass/i don't give a fuck what you say attitude. Low confidence doesn't work with girls. Also, working out makes you incredibly tougher and thick skinned than before. It's because of the increased testosterone production through the body and everyone knows low testosterone levels = low sex drive/low initiative to flirt/small talk with girls. \n\n&gt; They already know.\n\nIdentify the weak points, sob/feel sad at first, then improve on those points. I merely identified the points that **could** be improved upon that can make a big difference (and have worked for me and many others). \n\nBest of luck. \n\nEdit: **Sell the computer** and **stop whacking off to porn.**\n\n\n\n\n","parent_id":"t1_c0nakll","ups":-1,"subreddit":"seduction","created_utc":"1270092887","distinguished":null,"score":-1}

I no longer hang out with friends who drink, but sometimes I just end up going to the corner store to buy a couple of 40s.\n\nWhen it comes to my sex addiction I no longer really have any kinks.  When I was younger I did have kinks, and it did involve minors (I was a minor at the time).  Now I just seem to seek out anything I find nasty, dirty and disgusting.  It goes the same for both porn and sexual partners.  I find sex with say a typical girl \"boring\" because I cannot be as dirty as I want to be without scaring them. At the same time I get off on \"corrupting\" sexual partners who have never thought of doing the things I suggest.  But in my darkest hours, I have been known to seek out porn involving minors.  I do not consider myself a pedophile because I honestly am not attracted to minors, except for maybe the more mature looking 16 or 17 year olds.  When I have looked at cp, it's not about attraction but corruption of innocence.  When I have the impulse I seek the darkest I can find.  If I were to look at those same images during my rational state, it would make me sick to my stomach.\n\nMany of my impulses fit the description of hypersexuality, which is a symptom of mania or hypomania.  During those periods I feel powerless and unable to control myself.  I have tried abstaining so many times, but eventually I give in to my impulses.\n\nI have never had a positive view on sex, and always felt uncomfortable talking about it with friends or acquaintances.  I have been my own judge for so long that I do not want the eyes of other judges baring down on my soul.  I now have trouble maintaining eye contact, because I do not want to allow anyone to see the sadness and torment behind my eyes.\n\nI am going to take your advice and become more aware of when I am being self-critical.  I have been meditating which helps me unwind my thoughts from running off into a barrage of self judgement.  I am going to most likely attend my first sex addict support meeting this week.
