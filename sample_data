Like if I was just eating with a friend and someone barged in and tried to talk to me I would feel like they were intruding not just being friendly which to me would seem very rude.  I think there are certain situations where people are open to being approached and certain situations where you are just rudely interjecting yourself into a situation where you are clearly not wanted.  Like if your out at a bar there is sort of an assumption that you are there to have fun and may expect people to come up to you so even if they don't want to talk to you they will probably be polite (unless they are just sort of a bitch).  So I think it is important to realize the difference between being outgoing and friendly and when you are intruding.
